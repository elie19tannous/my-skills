## Executive Summary

`leakage-adversary` is a portable, independent data-science agent skill for: Actively search ML datasets and pipelines for target, temporal, group, split, join, and preprocessing leakage.

It solves a real operating problem: Models look excellent offline and fail in production because future or target information leaked into training. Leakage must be attacked like a failure mode; ordinary metric review usually detects it too late.

The design target is the level expected by senior data scientists, staff ML engineers, and governance reviewers: explicit evidence, reproducible checks, decision-grade output, clear owner questions, and enough structure for another agent to run the same workflow without hidden context.

## Research-Informed Design Standard

This skill was redesigned against patterns from high-quality public data-science and agent-skill repositories:

- Cookiecutter Data Science: predictable folders, immutable raw evidence, project docs, tests, and dependency discipline.
- Kedro: modular, reproducible, maintainable pipeline thinking.
- MLflow: lifecycle tracking, evaluations, registry/deployment awareness, and broad integration posture.
- Anthropic-style skills: portable folder with `SKILL.md`, scripts, references, and resources.
- Reproducible-research guidance: documentation, dependency management, version control, testing, collaboration, and transparency.

## Problem It Solves

Actively search ML datasets and pipelines for target, temporal, group, split, join, and preprocessing leakage.

- Primary pain: Models look excellent offline and fail in production because future or target information leaked into training.
- Why generic tools are not enough: generic notebooks, profilers, dashboards, and MLOps tools inspect pieces of the problem; this skill forces the agent to connect evidence, assumptions, owner decisions, risk, and next action.
- What the skill adds: Leakage must be attacked like a failure mode; ordinary metric review usually detects it too late.

## What This Skill Should Do

- Transform a vague request into an explicit Leakage Adversary decision with named owner, evidence, assumptions, and action threshold.
- Inspect local artifacts first: data extracts, schemas, notebooks, SQL, pipeline configs, model reports, tickets, and prior decisions.
- Separate mechanical checks from expert judgment so another reviewer can reproduce what was checked and what was inferred.
- Classify findings as stop, fix-first, monitor, accepted risk, or owner decision instead of producing generic advice.
- Preserve raw evidence and never silently mutate data, notebooks, model artifacts, or production configs.
- Return a decision artifact that can be handed to a data scientist, ML engineer, governance reviewer, or stakeholder without hidden context.

## Required Inputs

- training data
- target definition
- split logic
- feature list
- pipeline code or notebook

If an input is missing, the agent should inspect local files, schemas, notebooks, SQL, configs, reports, tickets, model artifacts, or metadata first. It should ask the user only when missing context would materially change the decision.

## Operating Workflow

1. Restate what information is available at decision time.
2. Probe features, joins, encoders, aggregations, and preprocessing for post-outcome information.
3. Check split logic for temporal bleed, group overlap, duplicated entities, and near-duplicates.
4. Review suspiciously strong features and validation performance jumps.
5. Return leakage findings with severity, evidence, and safer split or feature alternatives.

## Expected Outputs

- leakage attack report
- feature risk table
- split risk table
- safe evaluation recommendation
- blocker list

Every final answer should include:

- `Problem`
- `Inputs`
- `Checks performed`
- `Findings`
- `Decision`
- `Risks`
- `Next actions`
- `Artifacts`

## Concrete Use Cases

- Project intake: decide whether to proceed, fix prerequisites, or stop before time is wasted.
- Review gate: challenge a result when evidence is weak, assumptions are hidden, or a red flag appears.
- Handoff: create an artifact an engineer, analyst, governance reviewer, or another agent can continue from.
- Incident prevention: catch the workflow failure before it becomes a bad model, broken dashboard, or misleading executive claim.

## Red Flags

- feature timestamp after target
- same user in train and test
- global preprocessing before split
- leaky aggregate
- near-perfect simple model

When one appears, the agent must surface it, classify its severity, and tie it to a next action or owner decision.

## Agent And Provider Portability

This skill is designed for OpenAI Codex, ChatGPT Agents, Anthropic Claude, Claude Code, Google Gemini, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Goose, OpenCode, OpenHands, Gravity, LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, LlamaIndex, Semantic Kernel, and local LLM agents.

Use `SKILL.md` as the primary instruction. Use `references/agent-portability.md` for provider-specific adaptation and `MANIFEST.json` for machine-readable package expectations.

## Data Platforms

Use exported metadata, schemas, samples, logs, lineage files, model cards, metric reports, experiment records, or incident notes from Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, Postgres, dbt, Dagster, MLflow, DVC, W&B, SageMaker, Vertex AI, Azure ML, local files, or equivalent systems.

Provider output is evidence, not authority. Do not upload private data to external services unless the user explicitly approves that environment.

## Validation

Run these from inside the skill folder:

```bash
python scripts/quick_validate_skill.py . --strict
python tests/test_skill_contract.py .
```

Then run at least one clean, messy, and adversarial forward test from `tests/fixtures/`.
