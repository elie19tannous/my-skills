## Decision This Skill Supports

Design transparent, reversible cleaning plans for messy datasets without silently mutating evidence.

## Evidence Checklist

- raw dataset
- data dictionary if available
- analysis goal
- allowed transformation constraints

Also inspect any relevant schemas, notebooks, SQL, pipelines, configs, reports, model cards, experiment logs, tickets, dashboards, or incident notes.

## Execution Checklist

1. Profile missingness, duplicates, outliers, types, formats, units, and conflicting records.
2. Separate factual corrections, normalization, exclusions, imputations, and unresolved anomalies.
3. For each proposed transformation, record rationale, affected rows, risk, and reversal method.
4. Prefer derived clean columns or versioned outputs over overwriting raw evidence.
5. Return a cleaning ledger and transformed-data acceptance criteria.

## Decision Ladder

- `go`: evidence is sufficient and red flags are absent or accepted by the owner.
- `fix-first`: a concrete blocker can be remediated before continuing.
- `stop`: the work would be misleading, unsafe, unlawful, or untestable.
- `proceed-with-risk`: the owner accepts named risks and monitoring is specified.
- `needs-owner-review`: the agent cannot decide without a human owner.

## Evidence Table Template

| Finding | Evidence | Confidence | Owner action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fill this row | File, query, metric, or observation | high/medium/low | go/fix/stop/review |

## Red Flags

- overwriting raw data
- dropping rows without impact analysis
- unit conversion not documented
- outlier removal tied to desired result

## Senior Review Questions

- What would make this recommendation wrong?
- What evidence is missing but decision-critical?
- What has to be true at decision time, not just at analysis time?
- Which artifact lets another reviewer reproduce the check?
- Which stakeholder owns the risk?
