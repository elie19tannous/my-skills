# SVG workflow

Use SVG when scalable geometry, editability, clean paths, exact layout, or compact reuse matters. Prefer raster generation for organic painterly assets unless vectorization is explicitly required.

## Workflow

```text
PLAN → BUILD SVG → TEXT-ONLY VALIDATE & REVIEW
                        ├─ placeholder → STOP
                        └─ production → RENDER ONCE → VIEW
                                                        ├─ pass → DELIVER
                                                        └─ defect → REVISE → RENDER/VIEW
```

## 1. Plan

Decide whether SVG is appropriate, then judge its validation level:

- **Placeholder/prototype**: temporary art used to prove layout, interaction, or gameplay. Complete Step 3, then stop without rendering.
- **Production**: explicitly final, official, shippable, release-quality, or promoted from placeholder status. Complete Step 3, then require one successful render/view gate.

Default unclear cases to placeholder. Do not ask the user solely to resolve this judgment.

## 2. Build

Use a predictable structure:

```xml
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
     viewBox="0 0 512 512"
     role="img"
     aria-labelledby="title desc">
  <title id="title">Asset title</title>
  <desc id="desc">Short description</desc>
  <defs><!-- gradients, filters, masks, symbols --></defs>
  <g id="asset"><!-- visible geometry --></g>
</svg>
```

Prefer:

- a meaningful `viewBox`;
- stable grouping and IDs;
- `<symbol>`/`<use>` for repeated components;
- `vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"` when stroke width must stay constant;
- explicit filter bounds to prevent clipping;
- paths and shapes over embedded raster data when vector editability matters.

Avoid external fonts, remote images, scripts, or network dependencies unless the target runtime explicitly supports them.

## 3. Code-validate and text-evaluate every SVG

First, run `scripts/inspect_asset.py` for basic structural evidence:

- XML parses and the root element is `<svg>`;
- a valid positive-size `viewBox` or explicit dimensions exist;
- IDs are stable and references such as `<use>`, masks, filters, and clip paths resolve;
- graphic elements exist and common numeric geometry attributes are finite;
- external resources, scripts, `foreignObject`, or `role="img"` without an accessible name are reported as warnings.

Use `--strict-svg` only when those warnings should fail the current asset contract. Otherwise, inspect the source to decide whether external images, fonts, scripts, naming, accessibility, and deliberately used SVG features are intentional and supported by the target runtime.

Then evaluate the SVG shapes only from the SVG code text against the intended asset. This is a subjective semantic check, not another parser check. Reconstruct the likely composition from element types, groups, path data, coordinates, transforms, draw order, fills, and strokes. Judge whether:

- all requested objects and meaningful parts are represented;
- the chosen primitives and paths plausibly describe the intended silhouettes;
- proportions, positions, orientation, spacing, and occupied bounds make sense within the `viewBox`;
- layering and draw order produce the intended foreground/background and occlusion;
- fills, strokes, gradients, and detail density fit the requested visual role;
- no obvious shape is missing, duplicated, disconnected, inverted, or placed outside the useful canvas;
- repeated assets or icon-set elements follow the expected shared geometry conventions.

Do not claim pixel-level visual certainty or target-runtime compatibility from the script or text alone. For placeholders, this is the final subjective plausibility gate. For production SVGs, it catches semantic mistakes before the render/view gate.

Fix failures from either the objective validation or the text-only shape review before continuing. Both checks are required for every SVG.

## 4. Stop placeholders after Step 3

When objective code validation and the text-only shape review both pass, stop. Do not render, call vision, or create a PNG preview merely to validate a placeholder.

Keep placeholders simple and retain renderer-dependent uncertainty in the working context when relevant. If a placeholder is later promoted or the user explicitly requests visual QA, continue with the production gate.

## 5. Render-gate production SVGs

Use an available renderer such as a browser, CairoSVG, Inkscape, resvg, or a bundled SVG workflow. Prefer the target runtime's renderer when compatibility matters, and retain the selected renderer in the working context.

Render one PNG preview at the most decision-relevant size, normally the target in-game size or delivery resolution. Add another size or 2× edge preview only to answer a specific unresolved question.

View the preview with vision and check:

- silhouette and detail remain readable at the intended size;
- strokes do not vanish or dominate;
- filters, glows, masks, and shadows are not clipped;
- transparency is intentional;
- gradients, blend modes, fonts, and text layout render correctly;
- related icons share canvas, padding, stroke, palette, and optical size;
- the target runtime supports any animation mechanism used.

If the preview passes, deliver it without forcing another iteration. If a material defect is visible, revise the SVG and repeat the render/view gate until that defect is resolved.

Keep the source SVG and at least one approved preview in the production package.

## Raster-to-SVG conversion

Do not blindly trace a textured raster. Reconstruct clean semantic shapes for icons, UI, decals, and logos. If tracing is used:

- simplify paths;
- remove tiny islands;
- normalize fills and strokes;
- verify holes and winding;
- for a production asset, compare the rendered SVG with the approved raster at the intended size.
