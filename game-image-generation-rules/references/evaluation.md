# Vision evaluation

Define evaluation before generation. Use observable criteria and evidence, not “looks good.”

## Evaluation layers

### 1. Hard gates

Typical gates:

- correct artifact type and format;
- exact dimensions/aspect ratio;
- correct subject/count/action;
- true alpha when required;
- no crop or frame-edge clipping;
- correct camera/projection;
- required identity/reference consistency;
- sheet/frame geometry valid;
- safety/IP/content constraints satisfied.

Any failed gate makes the asset or variant non-deliverable regardless of average score.

### 2. Weighted quality criteria

Choose only relevant criteria and make weights total 100:

| Criterion | Typical evidence |
|---|---|
| functional readability | recognizable at intended in-game size |
| silhouette/composition | clear outline, focal hierarchy, balanced occupied bounds |
| style adherence | matches declared shape, line, palette, and material language |
| technical cleanliness | no artifacts, halos, clipping, grid errors, or broken alpha |
| reference consistency | stable identity, costume, proportion, camera, and palette |
| game-set cohesion | matches accepted assets and import conventions |
| animation quality | stable pivot, meaningful phases, loop and timing quality |

Convert each 1–5 criterion score to weighted points with `weight × score / 5`, then sum the weighted points for a 100-point total. Set a total threshold and any per-criterion minimum in the plan. A useful default is 80/100 total with no critical criterion below 3/5, but adjust for the task.

## Vision evaluation prompt

Provide the evaluator:

```text
ROLE: strict game-asset art/technical reviewer.
CONTEXT: intended use, target display size, references, and asset contract.
HARD GATES: explicit list.
WEIGHTED CRITERIA: names, weights, and anchors.
INSTRUCTIONS:
- Inspect the actual image, not the generation prompt's claims.
- Cite visible evidence and defect locations.
- Evaluate at target size and inspection zoom.
- Do not compensate a hard-gate failure with aesthetic quality.
- Return concise findings for the current working context: gate results, scores, defects, decision, and next action.
```

Recommended response:

```text
GATES: true alpha — FAIL; opaque white pixels fill all four corners.
SCORES: silhouette 4/5; blade and hilt separate clearly at 48 px.
DEFECTS: critical — opaque background at canvas border.
DECISION: edit.
NEXT: remove the background while preserving internal holes and crop.
```

Keep this assessment in context unless the user requests a persistent report.

## Score anchors

Use consistent anchors:

- **5**: production-ready; no meaningful defect for the intended use.
- **4**: strong; minor fix or acceptable small deviation.
- **3**: usable draft; visible issues require refinement.
- **2**: major mismatch or artifacts; substantial change needed.
- **1**: fails the criterion.

## Comparative review

When ranking variants for the same asset:

1. label images with temporary anonymous IDs;
2. reject hard-gate failures first;
3. compare the remaining variants side by side;
4. select the best foundation, not merely the most detailed image;
5. keep a brief reason in context for why the winner is easier to refine.

Use pairwise comparison if scores cluster tightly. Detail density should not beat functional readability.

## Reference and temporal drift

For each asset, variant, or frame compare:

- face/body/object proportions;
- silhouette landmarks;
- costume/part topology;
- palette swatches;
- camera angle and scale;
- light direction;
- pivot and ground contact.

For animation, view a contact sheet and the motion sequence. A single attractive frame can still belong to a broken animation.

### Objective animation evidence

Before visual scoring, collect any inexpensive evidence the available tools can provide:

- frame count, order, dimensions, and alpha mode;
- occupied-alpha bounds, empty/faint frames, and edge contact;
- scale/area outliers and baseline or pivot drift;
- palette or color-distribution drift;
- whether adjacent frames contain meaningful visual change.

Use these measurements to locate defects and write specific correction hints. They do not prove identity, motion semantics, or animation quality, and their thresholds should be calibrated to the asset rather than copied as universal constants. See `sprite-sheet/sprite-sheets.md` for workflow routing, extraction, sequence inspection, and packaging guidance.

## Iteration decision

- `accept`: all gates pass and thresholds met.
- `edit`: localized defect; composition and identity are sound.
- `regenerate`: global composition, pose, silhouette, or projection is wrong.
- `change pipeline`: repeated failure shows a backend capability mismatch.

When the same major defect persists, revise the prompt structure, references, control method, or backend instead of repeating near-identical attempts.
