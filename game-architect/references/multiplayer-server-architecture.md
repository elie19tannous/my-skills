# Game Server Architecture

Reference for planning game server architecture and selecting suitable framework families. This document is optimized for design work: choose the runtime model once, then map it through roles, topology, sync, recovery, and module-writing pattern.

Primary focus is authoritative online games. It also covers backend/platform services when they are part of the same product.

Complements `multiplayer-overview.md` (client/server logic split, authority model, sync style) and `multiplayer-protocol.md` (message design, serialization, heartbeat, reconnect) with server-side architecture guidance.

## 0. Server Architecture Design Flow

Use this workflow as the source of truth. Later sections are lookup tables for each step, not separate places to redefine the same runtime model.

```
Runtime Model
  -> Logical Roles & Ownership
  -> Process Topology
  -> Communication / Sync / Recovery
  -> Module Writing Pattern
  -> Final Distributed Process Architecture
```

| Step | Decide | Must Not Skip |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Runtime Model** | Pick room, encounter, scene/world, backend/platform, or hybrid | Do not mix runtime terms casually; choose the owner of live state first |
| **Logical Roles & Ownership** | Map roles and mutable state owners | Every mutable state unit needs one writer; cross-role writes need transaction, event, lock, saga, or compensation |
| **Process Topology** | Choose how roles are hosted and routed | Preserve routing/session/location rules from the chosen topology |
| **Communication / Sync / Recovery** | Choose dispatch, sync, targeting, persistence, and recovery policy | Define private filtering, reconnect behavior, idempotency, and crash outcome where relevant |
| **Module Writing Pattern** | Choose how gameplay logic plugs into the framework | Do not assume a typed interface or plugin hook defines ownership by itself |

---

## 1. Runtime Model Decision

Define runtime model terminology here only. Later sections should reference these names instead of re-explaining them. Hybrid means ownership separation first; it does not require separate deployable services at the start.

| Runtime Model | Best Fit | Core Ownership Unit | Typical Server Shape | Must Decide |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Room-based realtime** | Match-based games, lobbies, room-owned instanced sessions | Room or match | Room process/service with matchmaking and state sync | Reservation/join flow, reconnect window, disposal rule, checkpoint/replay need |
| **Encounter/combat service** | Stateful PvE flows, turn-based combat, lightweight battle instances | Encounter, battle, or workflow instance | Stateful service instance driven by API/service calls | Action idempotency, phase validation, checkpoint frequency, reward commit timing |
| **Scene/world realtime** | Persistent worlds, region simulation, AOI-heavy games, scene-owned instances | Scene, region, scene instance, or entity shard | Scene services with routing and handoff | AOI model, region transfer, entity identity, handoff and reconnect rules |
| **Backend/platform** | Turn-based, idle, social, economy-heavy games | Player, request, or domain service | API services backed by storage | Auth, permissions, consistency, transactional boundaries, async workflow policy |
| **Hybrid** | Most commercial online games | Runtime owner plus player/meta owner | Realtime runtime plus backend platform | Which state is runtime-only, which state is durable, and how side effects cross owners |

### Runtime Selection Shortcuts

| Situation | Start With | Watch For |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 2-20 player match game | Room-based realtime + persistent backend if progression exists | Do not put durable inventory/economy only inside room state |
| Step-driven PvE battle or turn flow | Encounter/combat service + player/meta services | Deduplicate retries and commit rewards once |
| MMO, sandbox, dungeon copy, raid copy, AOI instance | Scene/world realtime | Define scene-copy ownership, transfer, reconnect, and disposal |
| Async, idle, social, leaderboard, economy-heavy game | Backend/platform | Keep validation and permission checks server-side |
| Multiple game modes with shared accounts | Hybrid | Keep runtime authority and durable player/meta ownership separate |

---

## 2. Logical Roles & Ownership

Logical roles describe both distribution responsibility and write ownership. Do not create a separate ownership model that repeats these role names.

| Role | Responsibility | Usually Owns | Must Not Own / Must Decide |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Connection/Gateway** | Accept connections, heartbeat, protocol decode, session binding | Connection/session routing state | Authenticate before durable identity binding; clean stale routing; avoid gameplay authority by default |
| **Auth** | Identity validation, token/session issuance | Auth/session credentials | Gameplay state; decide token lifetime and session handoff |
| **Matchmaker** | Queueing, property matching, room assignment | Queue state, reservations | Match state; decide reservation token, capacity race handling, timeout cleanup |
| **Player** | Durable player and meta-system authority | Profile, inventory, currency, progression | Live room/scene simulation; decide settlement API and idempotent reward writes |
| **Room** | Session gameplay authority | Match state, temporary session state | Durable account/meta data; decide join, leave, reconnect, checkpoint, disposal |
| **Encounter/Combat** | Short-lived battle or turn-flow authority | Encounter state, phase/turn state | Direct durable reward mutation without commit policy; decide duplicate action handling |
| **Scene** | Persistent world authority | Region, scene instance, scene entities | Player account state; decide AOI, transfer, identity, scene-copy lifecycle |
| **Global/Domain** | Social, guild, mail, leaderboard, economy, auction | Domain state and cross-player aggregates | Per-room simulation; decide transaction/saga/compensation boundaries |
| **Persistence/DB proxy** | Database access, cache, batching, storage policy | Cache and write queues | Business authority by default; decide flush, retry, and crash policy |

### Deployment Profiles

| Profile | Processes | When To Use | Ownership Reminder |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Minimal** | Everything embedded | Prototype, small release, low CCU | Roles may share a process but should still have clear write owners |
| **Backend-only** | Auth + API + Persistence | Turn-based, idle, social, async multiplayer | Player/domain services own durable writes |
| **Combat service** | Auth + Player + Encounter/API + Persistence | Lightweight PvE combat, card battle loops, turn workflows without room allocation | Encounter owns active battle; Player owns durable outcome |
| **Small room** | Auth + Room/API + Persistence | Small session games with limited backend complexity | Room owns match state; persistence owns only storage mechanics |
| **Standard room** | Gateway + Auth + Matchmaker + Player + Room + Persistence | Mid-scale realtime match games | Matchmaker reserves; Room validates join; Player commits durable results |
| **Persistent world** | Gateway + Auth + Player + Scene + Global + Persistence | MMO or sandbox worlds | Scene owns world state; Player/Global own durable account/domain state |
| **Full platform** | Separate gameplay and domain services | Large products with multiple game modes | Cross-role writes need explicit workflow design |

### Evolution Rule

Start from the smallest profile that fits. Split processes only when one of these becomes true:

- One role has a clearly different scaling curve.
- One role has a pressure bottleneck.
- One role needs separate failure isolation.
- One role needs independent deployment or ownership by another team.
- One role creates contention because its writes should be isolated.

## 3. Process Topology

Process topology is a first-class decision extracted from real server framework shapes. It decides how logical roles are hosted, routed, and scaled; it does not redefine runtime models. Default to a single-process or modular monolith shape unless routing, migration, isolation, scale, or team-ownership pressure already exists.

| Pattern | Structure | Best For | Tradeoff | Must Decide |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Single-process monolith** | All roles in one process | Prototype, LAN, early production | Fastest to build, weakest scaling/isolation | Internal role boundaries and future split point |
| **Homogeneous multi-node** | Any node handles most requests; DB-backed state | API-heavy backends, BaaS | Simple scaling, weak fit for large in-memory runtimes | Request routing, optimistic locking, shared-cache policy |
| **Gateway-Broker-Logic** | External gateway, centralized routing, protected logic servers | High connection counts, command-routed architectures | More moving parts and routing complexity | Session stickiness, route registry, broker backpressure, failure path |
| **Actor/Location cluster** | Message routing through location or actor registry | Migratable entities, world simulation | More complex operations and debugging | Location registry, migration, mailbox ordering, entity identity |
| **Service tree cluster** | Process contains services, services contain modules | Custom platforms and service-oriented backends | Flexible but easy to over-design | Service lifecycle, module boundaries, retire/drain behavior, config topology |

### Service Discovery And IPC

| Concern | Common Choices | Use When | Must Decide |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Discovery** | Static config, shared DB, distributed KV, built-in cluster registry | Depends on cluster size and dynamic scaling needs | How nodes join, leave, and discover owners |
| **Routing** | Direct RPC, broker routing, actor location, pub/sub streams | Depends on ownership style and fan-out needs | Whether routing follows role, room ID, scene ID, entity ID, or domain key |
| **Presence** | Session registry, stream registry, online-location table | Match joins, chat, parties, reconnect | Expiry, reconnect token, and stale-session cleanup |
| **Events** | In-process event bus, distributed pub/sub, domain events | Cross-system coordination | Delivery semantics, ordering need, retry and compensation policy |

---

## 4. Communication, Sync, And Recovery

These tables capture communication decisions without repeating runtime model definitions. Also state the client trust boundary, server validation responsibility, and minimum observability signals such as logs, metrics, correlation IDs, and crash/replay evidence.

### Dispatch Patterns

| Pattern | Best For | Tradeoff | Must Decide |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Type switch / message registry** | Monoliths and fixed message sets | Simple but less scalable for large codebases | Versioning and unknown-message handling |
| **cmd/subCmd routing** | Command-driven servers and brokers | Efficient and explicit, less type-rich | Route ownership and permission checks per command |
| **RPC / method dispatch** | Typed service APIs and request/response systems | Good tooling, may hide protocol costs | Idempotency, timeout, retry, and authorization policy |
| **Actor mailbox** | Entity-centric ownership | Excellent isolation, more routing infrastructure | Mailbox ordering, backpressure, migration behavior |
| **Filter / middleware pipeline** | Auth, rate limit, validation, logging, audit | Great cross-cutting control, adds indirection | Which filters are boundary security, not optional decoration |

### State Synchronization Models

| Model | Best For | Strength | Weakness | Must Decide |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Automatic delta/schema sync** | Small to medium rooms, fast iteration | Low implementation cost | Less control over payload design | Private fields, dirty interval, late join snapshot |
| **Manual broadcast** | Competitive action, custom protocol | Full control | More engineering work | Targeting: all, except sender, team/subset, group/stream, single target |
| **Turn/phase response sync** | Encounter services and turn workflows | Simple authoritative progression | Less suitable for high-frequency realtime state | Request idempotency, phase validation, response snapshot shape |
| **Snapshot + AOI filtering** | Persistent worlds and ECS/entity sync | Strong world modeling | Higher complexity and bandwidth | AOI range, interest set, priority, ownership/property/role filters |
| **Lockstep / deterministic input sync** | Fighting, RTS, deterministic subsystems | Low bandwidth, fairness | Determinism and recovery are hard | Deterministic RNG/math, input schedule, state hash, rollback/replay policy |
| **Property replication** | Stable object state | Simple to use | Limited control | Use for stable properties; use event/RPC messages for one-shot actions |

### Rate And Recovery Decisions

| Concern | Typical Choices | Must Decide |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Simulation rate** | Fixed tick, frame-driven, turn/phase-driven | Whether simulation and broadcast rates are decoupled |
| **Broadcast rate** | Lower fixed rate, dirty interval, priority-based send | Which state can be delayed, filtered, or batched |
| **Persistence policy** | Write-through, write-behind, checkpoint, event log, input log | What can be lost on crash and what must be durable before acknowledgment |
| **Runtime recovery** | Fresh runtime, checkpoint restore, event/input replay, end-and-compensate | What reconnect sees after process crash |
| **Duplicate requests** | Action ID, sequence number, transaction key, idempotent commit | Which boundary deduplicates retries |
| **Reconnect** | Short timeout resume, registry-based resume, replay missed state, fresh join only | Resume window, token, location lookup, cleanup rule |

---

## 5. Storage Models

Storage is separate from authority. A database can store state without becoming the gameplay owner.

| Model | Best For | Notes | Must Decide |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Key-value/document** | Player saves, settings, inventory, flexible state | Good for owner-scoped blobs | Owner key, optimistic version, partial update strategy |
| **Relational** | Economy, guilds, social edges, transactions, leaderboards | Best when constraints and joins matter | Transaction boundary and contention strategy |
| **Component/entity storage** | Simulation-heavy systems, entity persistence | Fits ECS/entity ownership models | Entity identity, component versioning, load/unload policy |
| **Cache-aside / write-behind cache** | Hot data with persistent backing store | Must define flush and crash policy | Flush timing, invalidation, loss tolerance |
| **Event log / event sourcing** | Replay, audit, rebuild, match records | Strong history, higher replay cost | Snapshot cadence, replay limit, schema evolution |

---

## 6. Module Writing Patterns

Module writing is a first-class decision: it decides how game logic extends the chosen framework after runtime model and topology are known.

| Pattern | Core Idea | Best For | Weakness | Must Decide |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Class extension** | Extend framework base classes and override lifecycle | Opinionated room frameworks, fast iteration | Tighter coupling to framework | Which lifecycle hooks own create/join/leave/dispose behavior |
| **Plugin system** | Register hooks, RPCs, or match handlers into a complete server | BaaS and extensible backend platforms | Framework boundaries limit architecture freedom | Hook order, permission boundary, persistence side effects |
| **Annotation / metadata driven** | Plain classes discovered through metadata | Routing-heavy and framework-managed codebases | Implicit behavior can hide control flow | Discovery rules, generated routes, ownership of handlers |
| **Data-logic separation** | Data containers plus stateless systems operating on them | ECS/entity-heavy runtime and deterministic systems | Steeper learning curve | System order, mutation authority, deterministic data access |
| **Interface contract** | Shared protocol/interface defines handlers | Typed RPC/service architectures | Usually does not define state ownership for you | Which implementation owns state and which calls are commands vs queries |
| **Hierarchical composition** | Service contains modules and child modules | Service platforms and modular backends | Less opinionated about gameplay flow | Parent/child lifecycle, module boundary, graceful retire |

### Pattern Selection Matrix

| Priority | Prefer | Avoid Assuming |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Fast iteration and built-in room lifecycle | Class extension | That room lifecycle covers durable player/meta systems |
| Full backend plus custom logic | Plugin system | That hooks are safe authority boundaries by default |
| Low coupling and framework-managed routing | Annotation / metadata driven | That hidden routing makes ownership obvious |
| Simulation purity and ownership clarity | Data-logic separation | That ECS storage alone solves networking/recovery |
| Strong typing across network boundary | Interface contract | That types define write ownership |
| Explicit composition and custom service structure | Hierarchical composition | That module hierarchy should become microservices immediately |

## 7. Framework Family Fit Check

This is not a new decision step. Use it only after the workflow above has already produced a runtime model, role ownership, topology, communication/recovery policy, and module-writing pattern.

| Previous Decisions Point To | Framework Family To Evaluate | Verify Before Choosing |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Room runtime + class-extension lifecycle | **Room-based realtime framework** | Durable player/meta services, join reservation, reconnect, and disposal are covered or custom-built |
| Backend/platform runtime + homogeneous API topology + plugin hooks | **Backend platform / BaaS** | Authoritative realtime gameplay is unnecessary or handled elsewhere |
| Encounter runtime + request/response dispatch + idempotent turn workflow | **Stateful workflow / encounter service stack** | Duplicate actions, checkpointing, and reward commits are explicit |
| Scene/world runtime + actor/location topology + data-logic separation | **Actor/ECS runtime** | AOI, location registry, migration, persistence bridge, and reconnect are explicit |
| Typed service contracts + realtime channels + group broadcast | **RPC-hub realtime framework** | Matchmaking, ownership model, visibility groups, and persistence are not assumed for free |
| Gateway-broker-logic topology + cmd/subCmd routing | **Action-routing / broker framework** | Session stickiness, route registry, command authorization, and broker failure paths are explicit |
| Service tree topology + hierarchical module composition | **Service tree / custom microservices** | Module lifecycle, process topology, drain/retire behavior, and failure isolation are explicit |
| Narrow scope + experienced team + missing framework fit | **Custom lightweight stack** | Lifecycle, tooling, observability, scaling support, and recovery behavior are intentionally rebuilt |
