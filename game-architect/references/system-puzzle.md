# Puzzle Game System Architecture

This reference describes shared architecture for compact puzzle games such as match-3, jigsaw, water sort, block, physics, and board-game puzzles. It focuses on state transitions, resolution flow, physics and presentation boundaries, and content production. It does not assume every puzzle uses a grid, pieces, turns, or deterministic simulation.

## 1. Core Model

A puzzle asks the player to move a bounded problem instance from an initial state toward a goal through constrained operations:

```text
Puzzle = Definition + State + Actions + Transition + Objectives + Constraints
```

- **Definition**: Initial state, mechanics, goals, failure conditions, limits, scoring, and randomness policy.
- **State**: Authoritative runtime data that can affect gameplay outcomes.
- **Action / Intent**: An operation requested by a player, AI, or script.
- **RuleSet**: Action legality, preconditions, and local rules.
- **Resolver**: Advances state after commit, including cascades or simulation.
- **Objective / Constraint**: Evaluates progress, success, failure, and resource use.

A single screen, small space, and direct manipulation are common product traits, not prerequisites of the model.

| Conceptual Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `PuzzleDefinition` | Stores level data, rule parameters, objectives, and resource references |
| `PuzzleSession` | Manages one play session, phases, input, random state, score, and outcome |
| `RuntimeState` | Stores authoritative, inspectable, and saveable gameplay state |
| `RuleSet` | Enumerates or validates legal actions |
| `Resolver` | Applies atomic changes, cascade resolution, or continuous simulation |
| `ObjectiveSet` | Evaluates objective progress, success, failure, and draws |
| `History` | Stores snapshots, action logs, undo, and replay data |
| `ResolutionTrace` | Records ordered resolution changes and optional semantic events |
| `Presenter` | Continuously represents authoritative state through geometry, materials, animation, and presentation physics |
| `FeedbackLayer` | Maps semantic events to transient, degradable feedback routines |

**IMPORTANT**: These are conceptual responsibilities, not mandatory one-to-one classes. The table separates them explicitly for architectural reasoning; a concrete project may merge adjacent roles into one class and split them only when lifecycle, reuse, testing, or complexity requires it.

Keep genre-specific concepts—such as grids, containers, vector shapes, ropes, and board positions—in concrete puzzle implementations rather than forcing them into universal `Grid`, `Piece`, or rule-interpreter abstractions.

### Gameplay Domain Integration

`PuzzleSession` is the application-layer entry point: it converts input and use cases into `Action`, then delegates outcome-determining work to the gameplay domain through the `RuleSet`, `Resolver`, and `ObjectiveSet` roles. The domain reads `PuzzleDefinition`, enforces consistency while operating on `RuntimeState`, and returns `ResolutionTrace`; `Presenter` and `FeedbackLayer` remain outside the domain.

| Approach | Mapping to Puzzle Roles |
|---|---|
| [DDD](./domain-driven-design.md) | Model `RuntimeState` as an aggregate root or entity graph; place invariants and local operations on the aggregate, and use domain services for `RuleSet`, `Resolver`, or `ObjectiveSet` logic that does not fit one entity. `PuzzleSession` invokes the aggregate or services. |
| [Data-Driven](./data-driven-design.md) | Keep `PuzzleDefinition` as config and `RuntimeState` as plain runtime data; implement `RuleSet`, `Resolver`, and `ObjectiveSet` as systems or pipelines over that data. `PuzzleSession` invokes the pipeline. |
| Hybrid | Keep content and high-volume state data-oriented, while encapsulating complex rule clusters in domain entities or services behind the same session-facing roles. |

`History` records commands or state outside the domain model, while `ResolutionTrace` is the semantic output of a committed domain transition. These roles may still be merged into fewer concrete classes as described above.

### Common Simplified Class Designs

Most puzzles implement the conceptual roles with three or four concrete classes rather than one class per role:

| Simplified Class | Responsibilities Absorbed |
|---|---|
| `LevelData` / `PuzzleConfig` | `PuzzleDefinition`: initial state, mechanic parameters, goals, limits, scoring, and resource references |
| `PuzzleModel` / `Board` / `World` | `RuntimeState` plus `RuleSet`, `Resolver`, and `ObjectiveSet`: owns mutable gameplay data, validates and applies actions, resolves consequences, and evaluates the outcome |
| `PuzzleController` / `PuzzleSession` | Session lifecycle, input-to-action conversion, phase control, restart, and any required `History`; it calls the model and exposes resolution results to presentation |
| `PuzzleView` / `PuzzleScreen` | `Presenter`, trace playback, and often `FeedbackLayer`: represents current state, animates committed changes, and plays transient feedback without deciding outcomes |

Common further simplifications are:

| Simplification | Resulting Responsibility Merge |
|---|---|
| Session-centric | A single `PuzzleGame` merges `PuzzleController` and `PuzzleModel`, thereby absorbing session, state, rules, resolution, objectives, and optionally history. Keep level data and presentation separate. |
| Domain-centric | A `Board` or `World` absorbs state, local rules, resolution, and objective checks, while `PuzzleSession` retains lifecycle, input phases, and history. This is useful when the gameplay model needs independent tests or reuse. |
| Screen-centric | `PuzzleScreen` merges controller, presenter, trace playback, and feedback, but delegates all outcome-determining work to `PuzzleModel`. This suits small, single-screen puzzles with tightly coupled input and presentation. |

`ResolutionTrace` may be a small action-result object or event list rather than a dedicated class, and `History` may be an internal snapshot or command list. Split a responsibility back out only when its lifecycle, complexity, reuse, or testing needs become independent; do not move authoritative rules into the view.

## 3. Content and Representations: PuzzleDefinition

`PuzzleDefinition` is the read-only definition of a play session. It stores the initial state, rule parameters, objectives, failure conditions, limits, scoring, randomness policy, and resource references. It is generated by the content pipeline and does not store changes produced during play.

```text
Authoring Source -> Validate -> Compile/Bake -> PuzzleDefinition
```

One content concept may have several runtime representations, but it must have one authoritative authoring source; all other representations should be reproducible:

```text
Canonical Content
├─ Gameplay Data
├─ Query / Hit Data
├─ Physics Data
├─ Render Data
└─ Source Mapping
```

When authoring and runtime forms genuinely diverge, use Import + Validate + Compile/Bake. Gameplay code should not depend directly on raw source formats. Stable IDs and source mappings support references, errors, debugging, and migration.

For example, text strokes may use SVG as the authoring source. Import can generate stroke IDs, canonical curves, sampled polylines, arc-length tables, hit regions, and render geometry. If shape affects tracing rules, it is gameplay content; material, glow, and trails remain presentation.

Follow the [Gameplay Content Editor Architecture](./content-editor.md#21-selection-guide) to select an editor form. Spatial puzzles commonly need a [gameplay level editor](./content-editor.md#25-gameplay-level-editors) to author layouts, containers, anchors, goals, obstacles, and physical constraints; validate them through runtime rules, preview them with the real Presenter where practical, and compile or bake them into `PuzzleDefinition`. Runtime code must not depend on row positions, display names, or scene paths.

## 4. One Play Session: PuzzleSession, RuntimeState, and History

`PuzzleSession` is the application-layer coordinator. It references `PuzzleDefinition` and owns `RuntimeState` and `History`. `RuntimeState` stores only authoritative session data that can affect outcomes, such as the board, objects, active actor, resources, random state, score, and phase.

```text
Ready -> AcceptInput -> Validate -> Commit -> Resolve -> Evaluate
      -> AcceptInput / Completed / Failed
```

`PuzzleSession` decides when input is open, whether phases overlap, and how pause, restart, speed-up, and skip behave. A physics puzzle may accept input during simulation; a cascade puzzle may lock input until resolution finishes.

`History` stores snapshots, action logs, or both, and provides undo / redo, replay, save, and restore. Discrete puzzles can often record actions plus a random seed. Authoritative physics that cannot replay deterministically should persist key snapshots or state trajectories.

State should be inspectable and hashable. When determinism is required, the same definition, initial state, inputs, and seed must produce the same result.

## 5. Rules and Physics: RuleSet, Resolver, and ObjectiveSet

`RuleSet` enumerates or validates legal actions. `Resolver` commits actions and advances `RuntimeState`. `ObjectiveSet` evaluates progress, success, failure, or draws from the resolved state.

```text
Action -> RuleSet.Validate -> Resolver.Resolve -> ObjectiveSet.Evaluate
```

`Resolver` selects a strategy per mechanic:

| Mode | Behavior | Typical Use |
|---|---|---|
| `Immediate` | An action produces the next state immediately | Water sort, sliding puzzles, normal board moves |
| `CascadeUntilStable` | Repeats consequences until stable | Match-3, merging, sand clearing |
| `ContinuousSimulation` | Advances continuously on fixed steps | Cut-the-rope and real-time physics puzzles |
| `TurnBasedAdversarial` | Commits an action and changes actor | Board games and adversarial puzzles |

`Resolver` must determine whether physical simulation is gameplay-authoritative:

| Type | Test | `Resolver` Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Rule-authoritative | The physical process does not change the final result | Compute target state and trace directly; do not own presentation simulation |
| Simulation-authoritative | Collision, trajectory, or constraints change the outcome | Advance simulation and write its result into `RuntimeState` |
| Hybrid-authoritative | Different phases use different authoritative representations | Define conversion conditions, synchronization points, and state ownership |

For example, a sand-block puzzle rasterizes a landed piece into `SandField`, then lets a fixed-step solver determine settling and clearing, so the simulation is authoritative; SandField and required simulation state are written into `RuntimeState`. Large authoritative particle sets usually favor arrays, grids, cellular automata, PBD, or specialized solvers over one rigid body per particle.

For hints or automated validation, expose interfaces such as `GetLegalActions`, `Apply`, `IsGoal`, and `Hash` for solvability checks, deadlock detection, cost estimation, and solving. Automated tests should cover state invariants, unfinished cascades, and determinism requirements.

## 6. Presentation and Feedback: Presenter, ResolutionTrace, and FeedbackLayer

`Presenter` is the persistent world representation of authoritative state. `ResolutionTrace` describes how one resolution moves from old state to new state. `FeedbackLayer` follows the formal feedback architecture for transient sensory reactions to semantic events.

```text
Resolver ──updates──> RuntimeState ──represented by─> Presenter
         └─produces─> ResolutionTrace ─transitions──> Presenter
                                      └─events──────> FeedbackLayer
```

### Presenter

Presenter must maintain a correct world even when no event is occurring. It may own engine nodes, renderers, meshes, shaders, materials, animation, tweens, and non-authoritative physics simulations, plus the stable-ID mapping to presentation objects.

| Form | Input | Typical Use |
|---|---|---|
| State binding | `RuntimeState` | Boards, pieces, values, and UI |
| Geometry and material representation | State plus baked data | SVG strokes, liquid surfaces, sand, and rope meshes |
| Presentation simulation | State boundaries and parameters | Liquid slosh, rope shape, soft bodies, and fake physics |
| Transition playback | `ResolutionTrace` | Movement, merging, fracture, falling, and clearing |

Presenter may use tweens, shaders, or physics, but these techniques must not write authoritative state. If a simulation result can change the outcome, that simulation still belongs to `Resolver / RuntimeState`; Presenter only reads and represents it.

Non-authoritative physics and related presentation are assigned by lifecycle:

| Presentation Purpose | Owner | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Continuously represent the current world | `Presenter` | Rope shape, liquid slosh, sand materials, and soft-body deformation |
| Represent a state transition | `Presenter` | Block falling, merge tweens, and rope contraction |
| Respond to one semantic event | `FeedbackLayer` | Fracture debris, clear shake, and landing bounce |

### ResolutionTrace

A trace stores ordered resolution changes such as `Move`, `Merge`, `Break`, `Clear`, and `GoalProgress`. Presenter uses it to play the process. High-level semantic changes suitable for sensory feedback may be routed as gameplay events to FeedbackLayer. Continuous physics ticks, grain movements, and liquid samples normally synchronize through state, revisions, or shared buffers rather than individual events.

### FeedbackLayer

FeedbackLayer follows `Gameplay Event -> Feedback Routine -> Feedback Instances`: for example, `LineCleared` may map to a flash, SFX, haptic burst, and camera response. A routine owns sequence / parallel composition, priority, merging, throttling, and recycling. See [Effect & Feedback System Architecture](./system-effect-feedback.md) for the complete feedback model and concrete feedback types.

The same technology may appear in either layer; responsibility and lifecycle determine ownership. Feedback may degrade or be disabled without breaking the base world representation or changing gameplay outcomes.

## 7. Implementation Order

1. Define the minimal gameplay data model: the level-data schema, runtime state structure, action representation, transition rules, and objective conditions; validate the mechanic with hand-authored data first.
2. Implement the data model with a small concrete class set: `PuzzleDefinition` for immutable level data, and a compact `PuzzleModel`, `Board`, or `World` that owns `RuntimeState` and absorbs rule validation, resolution, and objective evaluation; complete and test the smallest playable state transition before splitting roles into separate classes.
3. Add a `PuzzleSession` or controller for input, lifecycle, restart, and phase control, then connect a minimal `Presenter` that can represent the current state.
4. Introduce a small action-result object or event list when presentation must animate committed changes; promote it to `ResolutionTrace`, and split out `RuleSet`, `Resolver`, or `ObjectiveSet`, only when cascades, simulation, reuse, or testing justify independent responsibilities.
5. Add `FeedbackLayer`, `History`, undo, replay, solving, save / restore, and automated validation only as the product requires them.
6. Build import pipelines, editors, baking, caches, and specialized runtime representations only as source complexity or content volume grows.
7. Optimize and further separate systems from measurements on target devices; do not pre-generalize a universal puzzle framework.
