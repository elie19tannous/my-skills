# Data File Design

Data file design covers how game configuration data and content are stored, processed, and utilized at development time and runtime. Effective data design improves iteration speed, reduces errors, and enables non-programmer content creation.

## Data File Design Principles

- **Designer Friendly**: Use formats and tools designers can work with directly, reducing programmer bottlenecks.
- **Performance Aware**: Profile loading paths; apply binary formats, compression, or caching on critical data.
- **Pipeline Friendly**: Organize data files to fit asset pipelines — support automated validation, transformation, and packaging across stages.
- **Format by Context**: Choose formats to match usage: text for authoring and version control, binary for runtime; ensure convertibility between them.
- **Versioning**: Tag data formats with version identifiers; provide automated migration when schemas change.
- **Documentation**: Keep schemas and conventions documented so the team can author and review data with confidence.

## Data File Formats

### Text-Based Formats
Human-readable formats suitable for version control and manual editing.

- **JSON**: Widely supported, good readability, no schema validation.

## Data Types & Structures

### Hierarchical Configuration Data
Structured data with parent-child relationships.

- **Characteristics**: Tree-like structure, nested objects, inheritance relationships.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Skill trees with parent-child dependencies
  - UI layout hierarchies
  - Scene object hierarchies
  - Quest chains with prerequisites
- **Format Choice**: JSON, YAML, XML.
- **Design Considerations**:
  - Define clear parent-child semantics
  - Support inheritance and overrides
  - Validate circular dependencies

### Relational Tables
Flat tabular data with relationships via IDs.

- **Characteristics**: Row-column structure, foreign key references, normalized data.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Item databases
  - Character stats
  - Localization strings
  - Drop tables
- **Format Choice**: CSV, Excel, Database (SQLite).
- **Design Considerations**:
  - Define primary keys
  - Use foreign keys for relationships
  - Normalize to reduce redundancy
  - Denormalize for performance when needed

### Image-Based Data
Using pixel data as configuration information.

- **Characteristics**: Visual editing, spatial data, color-coded information.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Heightmaps for terrain
  - Spawn point maps (color = entity type)
  - Navigation meshes
  - Biome maps
  - Lighting bake data
- **Advantages**: Visual editing, intuitive for designers, compact storage.
- **Processing**: Read pixel data at runtime or preprocess into structured data.

### Formula-Based Data
Using mathematical expressions as data.

- **Use Cases**:
  - Damage formulas: `baseDamage * (1 + attackPower * 0.1)`
  - Level scaling: `baseHP + level * 50`
  - Probability curves
  - Economic balance formulas
- **Implementation**: Expression parsers, embedded scripting (Lua, JavaScript).
- **Advantages**: Flexible, easy to balance, reduces data duplication.

## Data Processing

### Pre-Computed Data
Calculate complex data during build time rather than runtime.

- **Use Cases**:
  - Pathfinding navigation meshes
  - Lightmap baking
  - Occlusion culling data
  - Animation compression
  - Texture atlases
- **Benefits**: Faster runtime performance, reduced memory usage.
- **Trade-offs**: Longer build times, larger storage requirements.

### Data Compression
Reduce data size for storage and transmission.

- **Techniques**:
  - **Lossless**: ZIP, GZIP, LZ4 for exact reproduction.
  - **Lossy**: JPEG, MP3, video codecs for acceptable quality loss.
  - **Delta Encoding**: Store differences from base values.
  - **Quantization**: Reduce precision (e.g., 16-bit floats).
- **Application**: Asset bundles, save files, network packets.

### Data-Object Mapping
Convert data files into runtime objects.

- **Deserialization**: Parse data format into memory structures.
- **Object Construction**: Create game objects from data.
- **Validation**: Check data integrity and constraints.
- **Caching**: Keep frequently-used data in memory.

**Patterns**:
- **Direct Mapping**: One data file = one object.
- **Factory Pattern**: Data specifies object type, factory creates instances.
- **Prototype Pattern**: Clone base objects and apply data overrides.

### Data Pipeline & Editors
Tools for creating, editing, and importing data.

- **Excel/Google Sheets**: Designer-friendly table editing.
  - Export to CSV/JSON via scripts.
  - Use formulas for validation and calculations.

- **Custom Editors**: In-engine or standalone tools.
  - Visual editing for complex data.
  - Real-time preview and validation.
  - Integration with version control.

- **Import Pipeline**:
  1. Source data (Excel, JSON, etc.)
  2. Validation and error checking
  3. Transformation and optimization
  4. Output to runtime format
  5. Generate metadata and indices

## Logic in Data

### Embedded DSL or Formulas
Embed executable logic within data files.

- **Domain-Specific Languages (DSL)**:
  - Custom syntax for game-specific logic.
  - Example: Skill effect descriptions, AI behavior trees.

- **Expression Languages**:
  - Mathematical expressions: `damage = attack * 1.5 - defense`
  - Conditional logic: `if (level > 10) then bonus = 50`

- **Scripting Integration**:
  - Embed Lua/Python scripts in data.
  - Example: Quest trigger conditions, item use effects.

**Benefits**: Designers can modify logic without code changes.
**Risks**: Debugging difficulty, performance overhead, security concerns.

## Metadata Files

Companion files that store additional information about assets.

- **Purpose**: Store import settings, processing options, runtime properties.
- **Format**: Usually JSON, XML, or engine-specific formats.
- **Examples**:
  - `.meta` files in Unity (GUID, import settings)
  - `.uasset` files in Unreal (asset metadata)
  - Custom `.json` files alongside assets

**Content**:
- Import settings (compression, format, quality)
- Asset dependencies and references
- Custom properties for gameplay use
- Version and modification timestamps

## Custom Format Design

When standard formats are insufficient for performance or workflow needs, custom binary formats provide control over data layout, loading speed, and memory usage. Use when: loading speed is critical, need precise memory layout, need streaming or bundling, or need casual copy protection.

### Format Structure

**File Header**: Magic number (4 bytes, e.g. `GDAT`) + version + flags (compression/encryption/endianness) + TOC offset.

**Section-Based Layout**: `[Header][TOC][Section 0: Metadata][Section 1: Vertex Data][...]`. Each section has type, offset, size, compression info in TOC, enabling selective loading.

**Alignment**: Align sections to cache line (64 bytes), GPU data to GPU-friendly boundaries. Pad after variable-length data.

### Versioning

Forward compatibility via skipping unknown sections in TOC. Backward compatibility via version number in header. Provide offline migration tools between versions.

### Loading Optimization

**Memory-Mapped (mmap)**: File layout matches in-memory struct layout exactly. Near-instant loading, zero allocation. Trade-off: no compression, platform-specific alignment, larger files.

**Compression**: Per-section independent compression. LZ4 for speed, Zstandard for size. Dictionary compression for small repetitive data. Streaming decompression for large assets.

### Asset Bundle Design

Bundling multiple assets into single files reduces I/O operations and enables atomic loading of related resources.

**Bundle Strategies**:
- **By Scene**: All assets needed for a scene in one bundle (minimizes load-time I/O).
- **By Type**: All textures together, all meshes together (enables type-specific compression).
- **By Frequency**: Hot assets (always loaded) vs cold assets (loaded on demand).
- **By Platform**: Separate bundles per target platform with appropriate compression.

**Bundle Structure**:
- **Manifest**: Lists contained assets with IDs, types, offsets, and sizes.
- **Shared Dependencies**: Common assets referenced by multiple bundles stored in a shared bundle.
- **Patch Support**: Delta bundles that override or add assets without replacing the full bundle.

## Internationalization (i18n) Data

Managing multi-language content.

### Storage Strategies
- **Key-Value Tables**: String ID mapped to translations.
  - Format: CSV, JSON, or database.
  - Structure: `StringID, English, Chinese, Japanese, ...`

- **Separate Files**: One file per language.
  - Example: `strings_en.json`, `strings_zh.json`
  - Advantages: Easy to manage, can load only needed language.

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Group strings by feature/screen.
  ```json
  {
    "ui": {
      "mainMenu": {
        "start": "Start Game",
        "options": "Options"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
