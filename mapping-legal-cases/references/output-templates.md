# Output Document Templates

Exact structure for each of the 10 output documents produced in `.casebase/`. All templates follow these rules:

1. **Cite every claim** — every fact references a source file path: `file.pdf:p3` or `email.eml`
2. **Match corpus language** — write in the detected primary language (Hebrew, English, Arabic, etc.)
3. **Forward slashes in paths** — Unix-style, cross-platform
4. **Mask privacy values** — never quote full ID numbers, account numbers, etc. in outputs
5. **Include pending-extraction items** — tag with `[PENDING OCR]`, `[PENDING TRANSCRIPTION]`, `[PENDING VIDEO ANALYSIS]`

All templates below are shown in English. Translate section headers, dates, and structural text to match the corpus language.

# Gaps & Open Questions

**Analysis Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Missing Documents
Documents referenced in other files but not present:

- **[Document name]** — referenced in `email-2025-02-15.eml` as "the attached invoice"; not found.
- **Court filing receipt** — filed per `court-notice.pdf`, but the stamped copy isn't here.

## Contradictions Between Documents

### Contradiction 1: Date of incident
- `affidavit-witness1.pdf:p2` says **March 10, 2025**
- `incident-report.pdf:p1` says **March 12, 2025**
- Needs clarification

### Contradiction 2: Amount
- `demand-letter.docx:p3` demands **$180,000**
- `statement-of-claim.pdf:p4` claims **$250,000**
- Discrepancy needs explanation

## Unclear / Ambiguous Information
- "Several months ago" in `affidavit.pdf:p2` — specific date needed
- Unnamed third party in `email-2025-01-20.eml` as "the other guy" — identity needed

## Unanswered Factual Questions
- Who authorized the payment on [date]?
- What was the condition of the property when Defendant took possession?
- Did Plaintiff attempt to mitigate damages?

## Procedural Gaps
- **Filing receipts:** [N] filings referenced, [M] receipts found
- **Hearing protocols:** [N] hearings mentioned, [M] protocols found
- **Service of process:** no proof-of-service for [filing]

## Chain of Custody Concerns
- **[Evidence item]:** provenance unclear between [date A] and [date B]

## Pending Extraction (Critical Context Not Yet Available)
- `surveillance.mp4` [PENDING VIDEO ANALYSIS] — possibly shows incident
- `voicemail.mp3` [PENDING TRANSCRIPTION] — possibly from opposing party
- `scanned-contract.pdf` [PENDING OCR] — appears to be the original agreement

## Recommended Follow-ups (prioritized)
1. **HIGH:** Obtain the invoice referenced in `email-2025-02-15.eml`
2. **HIGH:** Resolve date contradiction
3. **MEDIUM:** OCR `scanned-contract.pdf`
4. **MEDIUM:** Transcribe `witness-interview.mp3`
5. **LOW:** Clarify "several months ago" reference

# Risks & Weaknesses

**Analysis Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

This catalogs vulnerabilities — content in the corpus that weakens the case or helps the opposing side.

## Case Weaknesses

### W1: [Description]
- **Nature:** legal / factual / procedural / evidentiary
- **Source:** `file.pdf:pN`
- **Problem:** [why this weakens]
- **Exposure:** how opposing side may use it
- **Mitigation:** [recommended strategy]

### W2: Delayed response to demand letter
- **Nature:** procedural
- **Source:** `demand-letter.docx` (2024-12-15); `response.pdf` (2025-02-20)
- **Problem:** 67-day delay could suggest acquiescence
- **Exposure:** waiver / laches argument
- **Mitigation:** document reason for delay

## Unfavorable Facts in Own Corpus
Facts in our own files that hurt us:
- **[Fact]** — per `our-client-email.eml` — our client acknowledged [damaging admission]
- **[Fact]** — per `internal-memo.docx` — suggests [unfavorable inference]

## Documents Helpful to Opposing Side
If opposing side accesses these in discovery:
- `email-2024-11-05.eml` — contains our client's admission
- `internal-note.docx` — contradicts current legal theory

## Weak Legal Arguments
Arguments thin on support:
- **Claim C3:** no evidence of [element] in corpus — consider dropping
- **Damages calculation in `claim.pdf:p4`:** inflated vs. actuals in `bank-statements/`

## Procedural Risks
- **Statute of limitations:** [date] — close to / past limit
- **Jurisdiction:** potential challenge based on [factor]
- **Standing:** [issues]

## Credibility Risks
- **Witness [name]:** inconsistent statement in `email-2024-09.eml` vs affidavit
- **Client's prior filings:** [if relevant]

## Opposing Side's Strongest Points
Anticipating opposing arguments based on corpus:
1. **[Argument]** — supported by [evidence in our corpus]
2. ...

## Risk-Reduction Recommendations (prioritized)
1. **URGENT:** Address W2 (delay) before [deadline]
2. **HIGH:** Prepare response to anticipated argument [X]
3. **MEDIUM:** Consider dropping Claim C3
